This is a basic game made back in 2020 with pygame based on a tutorial.
This is not meant to showcase my skills and is more of a personal learning project.


You can move the spaceship using the arrow keys and shoot with spacebar. I intentioanly put an invisible border on
how far up you can go. Don't let the meteorites pass the invisible border or you will lose.
